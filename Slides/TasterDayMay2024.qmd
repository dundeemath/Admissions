## Recent gradautes

Our recent graduates have gone on to work as:

* accountants
* trade analysts
* transport planners
* actuaries
* engineers
* teachers
* software developers
* data analysts
* and many others



## Mathematics degrees at Dundee

* Single honours Mathematics degrees
 - BSc Mathematics/MMath
* Joint degrees (e.g.)
    - BSc Mathematical Biology
    - BSc Maths and Economics
    - BSc Maths and Physics 
    - BSc Maths and Accountancy 

## What you will learn?

 - Core mathematical skills (e.g. calculus, integration, algebra)
 - Foundations of mathematics
 - Application of mathematics to real world problems

## How you will learn?

* Two teaching semesters in the academic year
* 3 or 4 modules in each semester
* In each module (some combination of):
    - lectures
    - tutorials
    - workshops
    - computer classes

## Final year project 

- develop independent problem solving skills
- work on an exciting mathematical topic
- develop programming skills
- develop presentation skills
- Topics include: 

    * The $25,000,000,000 eigenvector
    * Conformal mappings in   the art of M.C. Escher
    * The Mathematics of monopoly
    * How Sat Navs work


## Skills developed throughout your degree

* You will become a *logical numerate problem solver*
* Mathematical skills 

* Pure mathematics
* Applied mathematics
* Presentation skills
* Computer programming skills


# Aim: develop an app to explore an interesting mathematical idea

 * explore how programming can be used to explore mathematical concepts
 * develop programming skills
 * develop presentation skills
 * team work


## Design constraints

We want to identify some interesting problem (s) that:

* connect from high school syllabus to University level mathematics
* have an element of visualisation
* have some interesting mathematics 
* are interactive
* are accessible

## Let's look at some working examples 

<https://dundeemath.github.io/Admissions/>

- Explore apps


## Possible topics

* Graphing functions and their derivatives
* Recursion relations
* Trigonometric identities
* Differential equations
* Statistical tests
* Complex numbers
* What would you like to work on?

## What we need to do today

* focus on some ideas for a new app
* write some prototype code 
* decide how to make it interactive
* write some text to explain the ideas in the app
* build the app

##

 ## Prototype code that plots a trigonometric function and its derivative

 
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-fold: show
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dx=0.01
x = np.arange(0, 20, dx)
y = np.sin(x)

dy_dx=np.cos(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2)
ax[0].plot(x, y)
ax[0].set_xlabel('x')
ax[0].set_ylabel('y(x)')

ax[1].plot(x, dy_dx)
ax[1].set_xlabel('x')
ax[1].set_ylabel('dy/dx')

ax[0].grid(True)
ax[1].grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
