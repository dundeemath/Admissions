## Skills developed in maths degrees

* Students become *logical numerate problem solvers*
* Develop technical mathematical skills 
* Learn how to apply mathematics to different problems
* Develop computer programming skills
* Develop communication skills



## STEM skills are valuable

## Teaching delivery

* Two teaching semesters in the academic year
* 3 or 4 modules in each semester
* In each module (some combination of):
    - lectures
    - tutorials
    - workshops
    - computer classes

## Final year project 

- develop independent problem solving skills
- work on an exciting mathematical topic
- develop programming and presentation skills
- Topics include: 

    * The $25,000,000,000 eigenvector
    * The Mathematics of monopoly
    * How Sat Navs work?


## Aims for today

Use coordinate transformations to demonstrate some key tools used in mathematics:

- examples to develop intuition
- proof to make general statements
- computer programming to help solve and visualise 

##  How today's topic fits into our syllabus

* Key ideas in algebra and geometry developed in Core Maths modules in Levels 1 and 2
* Key programming languages used by mathematicians embedded in many modules
* Differential geometry (generalises many of ideas to curved surfaces).
- Honours projects allow focus on specific topics of interest.
