## Animal coats -  patterns in the wild

## Where do animal coat patterns come from? {.smaller}

## But it's ~~Developmental Biology~~ Maths Week Scotland!!

. . . 

We can use mathematics to

*  develop conceptual models 
*  test hypotheses in silico 
*  understand and predict behaviour of complex systems

. . . 

In turn, studying complex systems can result in the discovery of new mathematics.

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
# Aim for today

Develop and simulate a model of a pattern forming system 

:::

## Developing a mathematical model


. . . 

- What is the question?
- What are the variables?
- What processes are important?
- What kind of model is suitable?
- How would I know if the model was *correct*?





## Excessive rumour spreading in the school assembly hall {.smaller}

- Head teacher is concerned

- Students *interact* within small groups

-  Pattern in which some groups have high levels of rumour spreading.

- Within groups, a mix of rumour activators (A), inhibitors (I) and passive students (P).

- Membership of groups changes over time.

. . . 

::: {.callout-note}
# Hypotheses in the staff room

- A few bad 'uns

- Pattern is an emergent phenomenon 

:::

## Variables

Student have position: $$x_{i}(t)$$

. . .

Students can be in one of three states:

- Rumour activators (A) 
- Rumour inhibitors (I)
- Passive (P)

$$
s_i(t)\in \{A,I,P\}.
$$

## Process 1: state transitions 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="90%"}
Probability of passive (P) person becoming: 

-  an activator (A) is
$$
\propto \frac{ \bar{A}^2}{1+\bar{I}}
$$

-  an inhibitor (I) is
$$
\propto \bar{A}^2.
$$

::: {.column width="10%"}

-  Activator/inhibitor states are transient.


$\bar{A}$ is the local density of activators.

## Process 2 - random walk

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
* All students perform a random walk. 
* make up of groups mix over time.

## Running a simulation

* Initialise: no pattern in space or state.
* Define time (e.g. 0,1,.....,T)

* Loop over time, apply processes to update the variables


## Unpicking the simulations - state transitions + random walk

![](NiceSpotsLowDensity.mp4)

*  Density is low here to help visualisation


## Formation of spotted pattern

![](NiceSpots.mp4)

* Localised region of high activator and inhibitor 
* Diffusion of inhibitors is faster



## Differential equations and the Turing model


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"} 

* Let $u$ and $v$ represent concentrations of chemicals rather than people!
$$
u=u(\mathbf{r},t) \quad v=v(\mathbf{r},t)
$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u }{\partial t}&=D_u\nabla^2 u +f(u,v) \\
\frac{\partial v }{\partial t}&=D_v\nabla^2 v +g(u,v)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Breaking the pattern formation conditions

![](NiceSpots_DiffusionEqualHmm.mp4)
 

## Turing patterns ?

![Image from Maini and Wooley (2019).](MainiWooleyMontage.png)


Turing models

- produce a wide variety of patterns 

- proposed in many different patterning systems
-  sensitive to parameter values and initial conditions 

## Conclusions

- We can use mathematics to study pattern formation in the wild!
- Complex behaviours/ patterns can emerge when interactive individuals follow simple rules
- The extent to which evolution uses Turing patterns is an open scientific question
